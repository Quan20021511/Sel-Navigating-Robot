# Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance Robot

![Demo](demo.gif)

## Overview
This project demonstrates an autonomous robot built with Arduino that can navigate and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. The robot's movements are controlled based on sensor readings, allowing it to move forward, backward, turn, and avoid collisions effectively.

## Features
- Obstacle detection and avoidance using ultrasonic sensors.
- Autonomous navigation.
- Codebase for building your own obstacle-avoidance robot.
- Customizable parameters for sensor thresholds and motor control.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno).
- Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04).
- Motor driver board (L298N or similar).
- DC motors and wheels.
- Chassis and frame.
- Power source (e.g., batteries).
